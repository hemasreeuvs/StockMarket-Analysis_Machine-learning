# StockMarket-Analysis_Machine-learning

**Overview**

This project is a deep dive into stock market analysis using machine learning, particularly focusing on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. What initially started as a tutorial has evolved into a valuable learning experience, exploring not only the algorithm but also the nuances of working with financial data, creating regression models, and evaluating their effectiveness.

**What is KNN?**

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the most commonly used classification and regression algorithms in Machine Learning. KNN works on the principle that similar things exist close to each other in space. By identifying the 'K' nearest data points, KNN makes predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of the neighbors. The distance metric used here is typically Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space.

**Key Challenges and Learnings:**

Throughout this project, I faced several challenges and learned a great deal about machine learning, especially when applying KNN to stock market data:

1. Classification vs. Regression: Understanding when and why to use KNN for regression vs. classification tasks.

2. Quadl Library: Dealing with the quadl library to manage optimizations and calculations.

3. Accuracy vs. MSE vs. R-squared: Learning to assess model performance using different metrics, including accuracy (for classification) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (for regression).

As I continued to work with the algorithm, I noticed that while the model produced predictions, there was still significant variance in future values, indicating that more models and algorithms need to be considered for further improvements.

**Objectives:**

The goal of this project is to predict stock market prices using machine learning models, applying the KNN algorithm to provide insights into how well past data can predict future trends.

**Workflow**

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed stock market data, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features.

2. Modeling: Trained KNN regression models to predict stock prices based on historical data.

3. Evaluation: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to understand the prediction accuracy and the variance.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to find the best value for the hyperparameter 'K' (number of neighbors) in the KNN model.

**Key Findings:**

1. KNN is simple yet effective: Despite being a simple algorithm, KNN proved to be effective in predicting stock market trends when given the right data and tuned properly.

2. Variance and Uncertainty: Even though the model was able to predict values, the higher variance observed in the predictions indicates that further checks with other models are necessary.

3. Model Refinement: Before deploying any model in a real-world scenario, multiple models and adjustments need to be explored to reduce ambiguity and improve prediction accuracy.

Introducing sentiment analysis to enrich the stock market data and possibly improve prediction accuracy.

Implementing live data integration to create a real-time stock market prediction model.
